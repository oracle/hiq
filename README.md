> üî• HiQ now supports GPU profiling, DNN model visualization and tracing for DNN libraries like pyTorch, `transformers`, LAVIS, and LLMs like LLaMA, OPT, Bloom, T5 and GPT2 in addition to Onnxruntime, FastAPI and Flask.

HiQ is a `declarative`, `non-intrusive`, `dynamic` and `transparent` tracking system for both **monolithic** application and **distributed** system. It brings the runtime information tracking and optimization to a new level without compromising with speed and system performance, or hiding any tracking overhead information. HiQ applies for both I/O bound and CPU bound applications. In addition to latency tracking, HiQ provides memory, disk I/O and Network I/O tracking out of the box. The output can be saved in form of normal line by line log file, or HiQ tree, or span graph.

HiQ's philosophy is to **decouple `observability logic` from `business logic`**. We don't have to enter the black hole to observe it. Do you like the idea? Leave a ‚≠ê if you enjoy the project and welcome to say Hi to us on [Slack üëã](https://join.slack.com/t/hiq-myo2317/shared_invite/zt-17ejh6ybo-51IX6G1lHMXgLbq2HKIO_Q)

## Installation

- Basic Installation

```bash
pip install hiq-python
```

- HiQ also supports extra installation

```bash
pip install hiq-python[fastapi] # To support fastapi web server online tracing
pip install hiq-python[gpu]     # To support GPU tracing, which will install pynvml
pip install hiq-python[lavis]   # To support Salesforce LAVIS Vision Language models
pip install hiq-python[transformers] # To support tracing Hugging Face's transformers library
pip install hiq-python[full]         # To support all the cases, and this will install all the dependency libraries
```

## Get Started

Let start with a simplest example by running HiQ against a simple monolithic python code [üìÑ `main.py`](hiq/examples/quick_start/main.py):

```python
# this is the main.py python source code
import time

def func1():
    time.sleep(1.5)
    print("func1")
    func2()

def func2():
    time.sleep(2.5)
    print("func2")

def main():
    func1()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, there is a simple chain of function calls: `main()` -> `func1` -> `func2`.

Now we want to trace the functions without modifying its code. Let's run the following:


```python
git clone https://github.com/oracle-samples/hiq.git
cd hiq/examples/quick_start
python main_driver.py
```

If everything is fine, you should be able to see the output like this:

![HiQ Simplest Example](https://github.com/oracle/hiq/raw/main/hiq/docs/source/img/main_driver.jpg)

From the screenshot we can see the timestamp and the latency of each function:


|   | main  | func1  |  func2 |  tracing overhead |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| latency(second)  | 4.0045  | 4.0044  | 2.5026  | 0.0000163  |


HiQ just traced the `main.py` file running without touching one line of its code.

## DNN Model Observability & Visualization

HiQ can visualize DNN model. To get the following BERT model's structure, you can just run:

```
python -m hiq.vis
```

![BERT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/henrywoo/hiq/main/hiq/docs/medium/vis_bert.png)

The graph is self-explantory. There are several conventions:

- ‚ùÑÔ∏è means frozen layer, where `requires_grad` is false.
- üìà means gradient exists for that model parameter, which usually happens after backpopulation.
- `+`, bold font, and underscored dotted line mean the displayed layer is a folded version of multiple layers with the same structure.

What you need to do is just calling `print_model(model)` in your code. Refer to: [here](https://github.com/henrywoo/hiq/tree/main/hiq/examples/vis) for how to use it.

## Jupyter NoteBook

HiQ was originally developed to find Onnxruntime performance bottleneck in DNN inference, and it works well for other computation intensive applications too. The following are two examples.
